            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title">About</h1>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Tile Basic is a simple tile editor for pygame game developers. It allows the user to visually create a 
                tilemap that can then be exported as pygame code. The resulting code will create pygame code that will load the tilemap and draw it to the pygame screen.</p>
            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style = "font-size: 2.00em;">How to Use</h1>
            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style = "font-size: 1.50em" id="point-1">1. Opening Program</h1>
            <image src="content/images/Step1.jpg" width="100%">Launch Program</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">To launch the Python script, run TileEditor.pyw. You will be greeted by the following screen.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step2.jpg" width="100%">Startup Screen</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">The box on the top left is the image box. It will hold the images for tiles to be used in your game's tile map. To the right, you will see a 
                dark grey box with scrollbars around it and a light grey grid overlayed on it. This is the canvas where you will place your tiles to form a tilemap. On the bottom left 
                you will see a box with three icons in it. One looks like a cursor outline, the second looks like an eraser outline, the third looks like a cursor with a selection box. 
                The cursor icon represents the "draw" tool, the eraser icon represents the "eraser" tool, and the cursor with the selection box represents the "box fill" tool. These 
                tools will be used to edit your tile map visually on the canvas.</p>
            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style = "font-size: 1.50em" id="point-2">2. Opening Tile Images</h1>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">To get started go to the file menu and select "Open Image(s)" as shown below. If you are making a tilemap for a game, it is recommended that 
                you first place all of your tile images in the directory you will be using for the images used in the game. This is because the tilemap editor will be remembering the 
                images based on their path. So if you move one of the images later, the tilemap editor will not know how to find it.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step3.jpg" width="100%">Open Menu</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Once you select the "Open Image(s)" option, an Open File Dialog will appear. Select all of the images that you want to use as tiles as shown in the image below. Then 
                click "Open".</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step4.jpg" width="100%">Open Images</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">The Selected images will be loaded into the image box as shown below. Click one of the tile icons to select it.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step5.jpg" width="100%">Load Images</image>
            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style="font-size: 1.50em;" id="point-3">3. Tools and Map Editing</h1>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Draw the tiles onto the Canvas as desired. Move the mouse while holding the left mouse button to draw multiple tiles. You are currently using the "draw" tool. Notice
                how the draw tool icon is highlighted in red. This means that it is currently active. If you switch to another tool at any point, it will be highlighted in red to show that it is active.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step6.jpg" width="100%">Draw Tool</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">To Draw many tiles at once, click the "box fill" tool. Fill a square with tiles by clicking and dragging the selection box and then releasing it.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step7.jpg" width="100%">Box Fill Tool</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">What if you "mess up" as in the image below and need to erase some tiles?</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step8.jpg" width="100%">Mess Up</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Then select the eraser tool and click the tile that you don't want. Hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to erase multiple tiles.</p>

            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style="font-size: 1.50em;" id="point-4">4. Saving Your Map</h1>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Once you are done editing your tilemap, go to the file menu and click "Save Map".</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step10.jpg" width="100%">Save Map</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">You will be confronted with a dialog box like the one shown below. It will ask you if you want to save only the section of your map containing tiles or if you 
                would like to save the entire map (including empty rows). If you are going to use your tile map in your game immediately, it might be best to save the map without any empty rows as these 
                might get in your way when you try to draw the map to your screen in your game. If, however, you want to save your map for later editing before you use it in your game, it is best to 
                save the entire map with the empty rows.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step11.jpg" width="100%">Make Selection/image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Choose a save location and name; then click "Save".</p>
            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style="font-size: 1.50em;" id="point-5">5. Using Your Tile Map Code</h1>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">When you have saved your tile map, the code in the resulting python file should look something like this.</p>
            <image src="content/images/ResultingCode.jpg" width="100%">Resulting Code</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">To use the code in your game, first add the pygame base code.</p>
            <image src="content/images/AddPygameBaseCode.jpg" width="100%">Add Pygame Base Code</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Next define an instance of the TileMap class including a tilesize number in the class definition. This number determines the size for each individual tile drawn 
                to the screen in pixels. In this case, I'm using a size of 16 pixels</p>
            <image src="content/images/AddClass.jpg" width="100%">Add TileMap Class</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Next run the drawMap() function in the game loop. Include the screen surface to draw to and the location of the tilemap in the function call. Make sure that you call 
                the drawMap() function in the game loop after the code that clears the screen.</p>

            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">If all goes well, you should see your tilemap drawn onto the pygame window.</p>

            <h1 class="tile-basic-org-title" style="font-size: 1.50em;" id="point-6">6. Opening Previous Projects</h1>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">If you would like to reopen a previously saved project, go to the file menu and click "Open Map".</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step13.jpg" width="100%">Open File Menu</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Navigate to the location of the saved file and open it.</p>
            <image src="content/images/Step14.jpg" width="100%">Open File Dialog</image>
            <p class="tile-basic-org-para">Your tile map will be loaded into the tile editor. You can now edit it and save it again with the new changes.</p>
