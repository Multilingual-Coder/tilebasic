            <p class = "tile-basic-org-para">A lot has been added in this release! This really should have been broken into two
                releases. Firstly, Bill Roberts has added a function that displays the last clicked tile position on the topbar and
                suggested that the tool icons be modified to show which is active. Secondly, @MultilingualCoder has added a new 
                'box fill' tool which fills a rectangular selection area with the selected tile. An error has also been fixed. When
                the 'New File' menu item was selected, a TypeError was thrown because the messagebox module was being called without
                specifying what function in the messagebox module was being called.

            <p class = "tile-basic-org-para">Tile Basic now includes a scrollbar for the tile image box allowing for more tiles
                tiles to be used at once in your tile map.
